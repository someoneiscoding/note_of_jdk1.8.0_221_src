/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
 * behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
 * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
 * capabilities.
 * 一种可重入互斥锁。其基本行为和语义与使用 {@code synchronized} 关键字的隐式监视锁相同，但具有扩展功能。
 *
 * <p>A {@code ReentrantLock} is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
 * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
 * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
 * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
 * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
 * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
 * #getHoldCount}.<br/>
 * {@code ReentrantLock} 由上次成功获取锁但还未释放锁的线程拥有。
 * 当锁资源还未被其他线程获取时，调用 {@code lock} 的线程将成功获取锁，
 * 如果当前线程已经拥有锁，则该方法将立即返回。
 * 可以使用方法 {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread} 和 {@link #getHoldCount} 检查这一点。
 *
 * <p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
 * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
 * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
 * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
 * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
 * variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
 * starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
 * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
 * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
 * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
 * lock.<br/>
 * 该类的构造函数 {@link #ReentrantLock(boolean fair)} 接受可选的公平性参数。当设置 {@code true} 时，
 * 在竞争条件下，锁倾向于授予等待时间最长的线程访问权。如果为 false，此锁不保证任何特定的访问顺序。
 * 与使用默认设置(非公平锁)的程序相比，使用由多个线程访问公平锁的程序可能会显示较低的总体吞吐量（即较慢；通常较慢），
 * 但在获得锁和保证无饥饿的时间上差异较小。但是请注意，锁的公平性并不能保证线程调度的公平性。
 * 因此，使用公平锁的多个线程中的一个线程可能会连续多次获得公平锁，而其他活动线程则没有进行，并且当前没有持有该锁。
 * 
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock()} method does not
 * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 * is available even if other threads are waiting.<br/>
 * 还要注意，无超时时间的 {@link #tryLock()} 方法不支持公平性设置。
 * 如果锁可用，即使其他线程正在等待，它也会成功。
 *
 * <p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
 * follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
 * typically in a before/after construction such as: <br/>
 * 最佳实践如下：
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
 * class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
 * methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
 * methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.<br/>
 * 除了实现 {@link Lock} 接口之外，这个类还定义了许多 {@code public} 和 {@code protected} 方法来检查锁的状态。
 * 其中一些方法仅适用于监测。
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
 * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.<br/>
 * 此锁支持同一线程最多持有 2147483647 个递归锁。试图超过此限制将导致锁方法抛出 {@link Error}。
